# MCP Memory Server Deployment Guide

## Current Status ‚úÖ

The MCP Memory Server is **fully built and ready for deployment**:

- ‚úÖ **Authentication**: Logged into Cloudflare (`kristoffer.remback@gmail.com`)
- ‚úÖ **Vectorize Index**: Created `memory-embeddings` (768 dimensions, cosine metric)  
- ‚úÖ **Code Ready**: TypeScript builds successfully (9.4kb bundle)
- ‚úÖ **Storage Working**: Durable Objects + vector embeddings tested locally
- ‚úÖ **Bindings Configured**: MEMORY_STORAGE and VECTORIZE properly set up

## Next Step Required

**Set up workers.dev subdomain** (one-time setup):

1. Visit: https://dash.cloudflare.com/workers
2. Open the Workers landing page (this creates the subdomain automatically)
3. Choose your subdomain name (e.g., `your-name.workers.dev`)

## After Subdomain Setup

Run deployment:
```bash
npx wrangler deploy --env=""
```

Expected result: Server deployed to `https://mcp-memory-server.your-name.workers.dev`

## Testing Remote MCP Server

Once deployed, the server will be accessible at:
- **Health Check**: `https://mcp-memory-server.your-name.workers.dev/`
- **API Test**: `https://mcp-memory-server.your-name.workers.dev/api/test`
- **MCP Endpoint**: `https://mcp-memory-server.your-name.workers.dev/mcp` (future)

## Features Available After Deployment

üß† **Memory Operations**:
- Store memories with vector embeddings
- Semantic search across memories  
- Namespace organization (general, people, projects, etc.)
- Label-based filtering

üèóÔ∏è **Infrastructure**:
- Global edge deployment via Cloudflare Workers
- Durable Objects for persistent storage
- Vectorize for semantic similarity search
- Zero cold starts with hibernation support

## Integration with Claude

After deployment, the remote MCP server can be connected to Claude Desktop/Mobile with the public HTTPS URL for secure, persistent memory across all devices.
